# Dasher3D
Once a colleague of mine thought aloud "How would a 3D Boulder Dash game look like?". I thought to give a try...

To test, install .apk file (in Installable file folder) to your Android device. Then play with Daydream, Cardboard, or by just looking around with Magic Window option.

Object of the game: Find all the diamonds, but don't get hit by a stone.
Hints:
-Tap (or with cardboard say something to tap) to destroy sand & move around. You can see the map below you (and change the floor the map shows).
-To get to next floor you'll need to climb the ladders, i.e. touch the ladders in the upper floor.
